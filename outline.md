## Abstract

_Quantum computing is an exciting and growing field.
To realize quantum applications, we need a new generation of programmers ready to leverage quantum technologies.
As one of the most actively used languages in scientific computing, Python lets us reduce barriers to engaging new learners in quantum computing._

_In this talk, Sarah will introduce quantum computing hands-on, and will show how Python can be used to work new quantum programming languages like Q#, an open-source high-level language for quantum computing from Microsoft. Using Python and Q# together, Sarah will demo core quantum computing, and will share resources on how you can get started learning and developing for a quantum computer, and how you can join the growing quantum community!_
